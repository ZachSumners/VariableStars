The VariableStarAnalysisUpdated file will detect variable stars given large apeture photometry datasets produced by Mira. Photometry data must be over time to see differential photometry variation. Code has been tested for 5000+ stars over 100+ images, all in one CSV.

It is very important to use Mira apeture photometry CSVs, as certain headers are required.
